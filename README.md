# LabRender

A simple OpenGL based render engine. Its most interesting feature is that it
has a software configured pipeline architecture. See the assets/pipelines
directory for some example pipeline configurations.

## Usage

See the examples directory for an example.

## Building

Run cmake in the root directory picking the generator you wish to use.

Currently, LabRender is tested on Windows 10, with VS2019 or greater.
